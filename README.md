# Nano React

The template project for [nano-react-app](https://github.com/adrianmcli/nano-react-app).

This is a React simple application, that fetches data from an Axios API that generates random, miscellaneous advice.
I used Nano, due to it's relatively small package size, which maximizes the app's efficiency, and virtually eliminates bloatware, as compared to other package managers.

## To Start

In order to run, clone the repository to your local drive.
Run npm install
After all depenencies are installed, run npm start to launch the application.
